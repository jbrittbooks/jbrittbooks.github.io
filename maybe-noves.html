Set in the south of America, the locations are vividly depicted and the author skilfully draws the reader into her world. Some of the religious aspects may not be to everyone's taste, but Christians will no doubt lap this up."</div>

                                      <div>"W.O.O.F.--This is a great, easy read...read this uplifting, Word-filled, Christian fiction book. This was the first time I read any thing by this author and it will not be my last. Great plots and just a great read. A singles group or woman's book club could really benefit from reading this book. Just when I was about to give up on reading a decent novel here comes this book!"</div>

                                      <div>Wow! I just finished Pickin' Ground...once I first picked it up I couldn't wait to pick it up again. You are such a good writer & storyteller. The suspense was killing me! I'm so glad I bought the series, because I definitely have to read more of your works. Keep doing what you do!"</div>

                                      <div>"Empty Envelope is spectacular! It's a Spirit-filled love story...that shows what the Lord can do when we do it His way. It also shows how adult romances can impact their kids--whether they realize it or not."</div>
