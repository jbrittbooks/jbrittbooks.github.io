                                <div class="text-start mt-4">Preacher’s kids, Money and Melissa, have been going to church all of their lives; Wanza and Yteesha, not so much. But none of that matters if Mother Whatnot’s conviction is true: “Everybody at church ain’t in church.” Their lives intersect when Melissa, oh, so sweetly, steals Wanza’s ambitious, empire-building husband, Douglas, who happens to be promoting a star-studded mega concert as the grand gala for Fisk University’s Sesquicentennial Celebration. Douglas also chairs the Finance Committee at True Vine Ministries, Inc. where Melissa has aligned herself in order to get up-close-and-personal with Nashville’s rich and famous elite. It’s not the first time finance has turned to romance, but it certainly turns up the heat when they all find themselves—Dipped in the Fire—a story of great tragedy and great joy!
