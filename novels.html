But, in the meantime, if Lucille Jackson has anything to say about it, her husband, Bertram--the first black sheriff ever elected in the region--will be working overtime to keep Screamer, South Carolina from living up to its name which is deeply rooted in its racist past. The Jacksons are determined to keep the black community safe and to make sure black lives matter. Along the way, however, they all may make a startling discovery:<em>"...all racists ain't white..."</em>

But none of that matters if Mother Whatnot’s conviction is true: “Everybody at church ain’t in church.” Their lives intersect when Melissa, oh, so sweetly, steals Wanza’s ambitious, empire-building husband, Douglas, who happens to be promoting a star-studded mega concert as the grand gala for Fisk University’s Sesquicentennial Celebration. Douglas also chairs the Finance Committee at True Vine Ministries, Inc. where Melissa has aligned herself in order to get up-close-and-personal with Nashville’s rich and famous elite. It’s not the first time finance has turned to romance, but it certainly turns up the heat when they all find themselves—Dipped in the Fire—a story of great tragedy and great joy!

                                <div class="text-start mt-4">Lottie is the third book in the series. By this time, Lottie has been elected as the first African-American female to the Alabama State Senate, and she is a new bride. She struggles with the challenges of both roles until her faith gets her priorities straight. With the help of her husband and friends, she dismantles the good-ole-boy political machinery that has plagued her district for decades, despite the risk to her own personal safety. Having overcome insurmountable odds, Lottie learns to revel in her husband’s fiery, committed love, and comes to realize . . . there is no love like married love!</div>

Set in the south of America, the locations are vividly depicted and the author skilfully draws the reader into her world.
